## ⚠️ CRITICAL SETUP INSTRUCTION ⚠️

**Please Read Before Running:**
To comply with GitHub file size limits, the `age_net.caffemodel` file included in this repository is a **dummy placeholder**. The application will **crash** if you do not replace it with the real model weights.

**Steps to Fix:**
1. **Delete** the existing `age_net.caffemodel` file in your root folder.
2. **Download** the real model (44MB) from this link:  
   👉 [**Download Real AgeNet Model**](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/raw/master/AgeGender/age_net.caffemodel)
3. **Place** the downloaded file in the root directory of this project.
